makefile usage:

differs:
	1. "/bin/ls|" will execute "/bin/ls" without any error info.
	   The idea is that when we type "ls|" in bash shell, it will prompt out ">" and wait for the 2nd 
	   command of the pipe. Though I do not implement this feature, I think it is ok to consider that
	   "bin/ls||" is a right command and ignore the "|"

	2. "/bin/ls||" will report an error without executing "/bin/ls"
	   Though "ls||" is the same with "ls|" in bash shell, and "ls|||" is considered an invalid command
	   in bash shell. I treat "/bin/ls||" as an invalid command, as well as "/bin/ls|||"
***********************
additional info:
	1. The Marco HISTORY_SIZE is set to 101, but the "distory" command will display 100 comands. 
	   Just for clear that.
